# WhatToWearToday #
# Swifty Protocol-Oriented with Dependency Injection #
WhatToWearToday - iOS App.

    - WhatToWearToday is an app that provides weather for today, or the next 5 days for any city
    selected from the map or from search.
    - User location will be used from GPS if permission was given, otherwise, it will be use approximate

### Swifty Protocol-Oriented Dependency Injection ###

    * The key to dependency injection is protocols â€“ from there sprouts many variations,
    flavours, and techniques.
    * Battle-tested DI implementation with no outside dependencies or magic. 
    * It combines protocol extension and type erasure to give you a solid, flexible dependency
    injection that works great with unit test and even frameworks.
